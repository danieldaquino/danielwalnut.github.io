<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>here was this christmas, a couple of years ago, when I had to think of a gift to give someone. I knew I had to be creative and give something different. I wanted it to be artistic. I don't paint, I don't play guitar but, I can do at least one thing: Technology Art. The Web was my canvas, and I decided to paint a daisy on it.</p>
<h2>The Daisy</h2>
<p>What I did was to create an animated daisy flower, in an environment that changed. I used my design skills to create animations that resemble the wind, transitions that resemble the sunset or the sunriseâ€¦ And a moving sun and moon.</p>
<p>See the result below. Make sure to come back at different times of the day ;)</p>
