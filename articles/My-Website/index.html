<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span> started this website with the purpose of sharing my work and my passion with other people. It is also a place where I can keep progress of my own work.</p>
<h2>The logo</h2>
	<img class="square" style="margin-top: -40px;" src="articles/My-Website/3.png"/>
	<p>The Final logo has both curves and sharp edges, creating a balance between the symbology of high tech and more liberal art. It emphasizes the first letter of my name. It is red to symbolize passion.</p>

<h2>Inspiration, color palette and fonts</h2>
<p>I wanted two things to set the theme for my website:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The dichotomy of Tech and Art</li>
	<li>Minimalism</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for my fonts, I chose one serif font, which is very artsy, and one slab serif font, which has sharp edges, giving it a more high-tech look. For my colour palette, I chose three:</p>
<ul>
	<li>White</li>
	<li>Gray</li>
	<li>Red</li>
</ul>
<p>These colours are inspired by Zen Buddhist Japanese calligraphy, which is generally done with a black-gray ink on a white piece of paper, as generally also has the signature stamp, which is red. Zen Buddhism is one of the philosophies associated with minimalism.</p>
<p>Also, gray and white show posture and simplicity, while red shows passion.</p>
