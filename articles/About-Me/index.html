<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span><b>o set minds free… to create and explore.</b> This is my motto, my mantra. Why? I am passionate about technology, I am passionate about art. My ambition is to create world-changing tools for passionate, creative and curious minds like mine. One of the most beautiful things in life is to see unique ideas unfold into reality. New technologies, new designs that awake our souls to new realities, to new sounds and colours. People who have a dream, that's who I want my technology to serve for.</p>
<h2>Technology Artist</h2>
<p>Perhaps one the most ingenious people in history, Leonardo Da Vinci, had it right. Unlike most people, he saw technology and art as two faces of the same coin. I could not consider myself to be just an Artist, and I could not consider myself to be just a Technologist. To me, Art is Technology, and Technology is Art, and that's why I like to consider myself a Technology Artist.</p>
<h2>A bit about my past</h2>
<p>I was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1997. I also lived part of my childhood in the small town of "Rio das Ostras".</p>
<p>When I was about seven, I became so fascinated about technology that I would pretend to have my own tech company, I would "invent" all sorts of gadgets, I would fold paper to make an almost rigid shape of the gadget, draw the buttons, the screens on the folded paper, and I pretend it was real.</p>
<p>When I was 10, my father taught me the basics of how hydro power works. That opened my eyes to the fact that I did not need to wait for school to teach me things. I could learn them on my own. That was one of the most important things I learned. That lead me to teach myself web programming with an old dusty book, at a time when people still thought kids couldn't learn how to code. Since then, I never stopped coding.</p>
<p>Ever since, I've been trying to create companies and tech products. I've been trying to turn my ideas into reality. That is my goal, my passion, my obsession.</p>
<p>Now, I am a Student/Tech Entrepreneur in Metro-Vancouver. My mind is free… to create and explore. How about yours?</p>
