<h1>The Deck App</h1>

<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n 2015, I joined a team to create a parking app for the Brazilian market. We noticed the city did not have any parking app with a good presence in the city, even though it has serious traffic issues, which would make such app highly useful. I was the developer of the app, as well as the designer.</p>
<h2>VagaCerta</h2>
<p>VagaCerta (this translates to either "The right parking spot" or "Certain parking spot") was the first name we wanted to give to the company. Our emphasis was on three things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ease of use</li>
	<li>Presence</li>
	<li>Parking Availability information</li>
</ul>
<h2>The First Logo</h2>
<p>We wanted to be simple. So, our design had to follow suit. That's why our color palette had only the three colours of the streets: Gray, Yellow, White.</p>
<p>Our logo is just a simple diagonal parking space. Here is what it looked like:</p>

<h2>It's simple as a deck of cards!</h2>
<p>I started developing our MVP, and I thought that our UI had not to be just a simple list, or a map. We thought that most people would not anticipate getting a parking spot while entering their car. We knew most people would grab their phones in the last minute and look for a parking spot while they are near the destination. By no means we wanted people to use their phones while driving, but we know that some users would, that's why we wanted to make it as safe as possible. </p>

</p>
<p>The deck of cards UI seems perfect for this purpose. It can be handled with just one hand, and it would use smart algorithms to show the best option right upfront, so that the user could go from 0 to setting up the GPS in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<h2>The prototype</h2>

</p>
<p>When the first prototype (version 0.1 alpha) was ready, I made a small promo video using real life footage and some motion graphics, so that we could use it as part of our pitch when we where looking for business partners and incubators. The video explains what the app is about, and shows a small demonstration of the app working. The video is below (available in portuguese only):</p>

<h2>The change of name and the end of project</h2>

</p>
<p>While looking for potential partners and planning our first launch, we decided we should change our name into something more memorable. That's when the name "Deck" came. I designed the new logo, more attractive and solid than the previous one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during that period, our team had unsolvable issues and the project was cancelled.</p>
