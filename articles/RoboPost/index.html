<p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>n May 16th, 2018, walking through the streets next to the Vancouver Waterfront, with seagulls flying freely above, and the Sun planning to show up, I receive a text message. My teammate was ready for the exciting day. <i>Let's rewind a bit.</i></p>

<h2>The beginning — A Capstone Project</h2>
<p>After almost two years of so much hard work in the intensive and challenging BCIT Robotics program, the final term knocks on our door. And with it, the Final Capstone Project.</p>
<p>The Challenge? To design and create an autonomous Robot completely from <b>scratch</b>. In <i>four</i> months. While handling <i>(six!)</i> other intensive courses. My friend Tim and I were in for a big adventure.</p>
<p>We decided to build a Robot that follows a line, and with it, create a small scale automated delivery system.</p>
<h2>First month — A tough start</h2>
<p>In this first stage, we were very careful about component selection. The maximum quality of the Robot depended on it. Yet, there are so many assumptions that we simply cannot fully test until we actually build it. At some point, we just had to take the risk.</p>
<p>As the weeks went by, the components finally came, and development started. With 6 courses, each with their labs, and dealing with a problematic board, we started getting behind schedule. <b>Dangerously behind.</b></p>
<h2>Spring Break – The birth</h2>

<p>With all problems, we knew we had to change something. And we did. After much thinking, we threw away all the software for the previous board and decided to instead integrate two boards. A more risky approach, but we were confident it was the right way to go.</p>
<p>And suddenly we had the chance to change things around. <i>Spring Break</i>. We decided we would have something running on the ground before the end of the week.</p>
<p>We worked from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep, with very long nights in the lab.</p>
<p>Progression was fast. At the end of that week, <i>we had it running on that floor</i>. From then on, we kept working on it, dedicating every single weekend since then.</p>
<h2>The last week — The last (big) touch</h2>

<p>On the last week of the project, we had a functional robot, following a line smoothly, fork detection, real time measurements through Wi-Fi, a Web interface, and Station (Destination) Detection.</p>
<p><b>To us, this was not enough.</b></p>
<p>We were not satisfied with the huge amount of electronic connections, which made it hard to use the Robot, and wasn't pleasant to look at.</p>
<p>We stepped in and decided we would design our own PCB board to connect everything in the Robot. None of us had ever done one before. We had to learn on the fly, with some teachers checking our work.</p>
<p>Without enough lead time to get it fabricated, we also had to manufacture it ourselves, with some guidance.</p>

<p>After almost an entire day of labour, the board was ready! Also that was left to do was… <b>disassemble all the Robot, and reassemble it</b> with the new piece — <i>few days before the deadline.</i></p>
<h2>Demonstration of the Robot</h2>

<p>The full firmware and web interface code is available in Github. <a href="https://github.com/danielwalnut/RoboPost" target="_blank">RoboPost Code Repository</a>
<h2>The Big Surprise – The BC Tech Summit</h2>
<p>In the end, it all worked… And then we, along with some other very talented people in BCIT, were invited to present our project and represent BCIT at the <b>BC Tech Summit 2018!</b></p>
<p>We were very happy to represent BCIT, and specially the Robotics Program, which has been such a great learning experience and an adventure.</p>
