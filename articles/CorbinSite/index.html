<p><span class="firstcharacter">C</span>orbin Hale, the vintage pop artist, asked me to design a logo and a website. After many iterations, a beautiful vintage website emerged together with his eye-catching logo.</p>
<h2>The Landing Page</h2>
<p>Before Corbin Hale even had the name Corbin Hale, he was thinking of naming himself Corbin Thompson. Afraid of having someone else use this name, he quickly bought a domain name and now he needed a landing page.</p>
<p>He came to me one night and explained the whole concept of his artistic style. I made some sketches and we decided that we would make a great use of fabric to set the vintage theme. The message layout was inspired by those jeans labels, and the background's pattern was inspired by my own handbag. In the end, it turned out to be a great combination! The result is as below.</p>

<h2>The Old 50's Theater</h2>
<p>As soon as I started designing the website, he changed his artistic name to Corbin Hale. For the website, we were brainstorming many ways we could transmit the idea of vintage. He wanted the website to seem like it came from the 50's. So, I thought "What's more 50's"ish" than an old movie theater full of neon lights?" And so I did a mockup, and then the design itself. The result is as below: (Or <a target="_blank" href="articles/CorbinSite/Old50s/">click here</a> for demo)</p>

<h2>The Logo</h2>

<p class="pullquote">"It's classy, vintage and it just seems like there is not a thing I'd change in it" â€“ Corbin Hale</p>
<p>This Logo was designed before the website was ready because the artist needed it for his YouTube Channel. It was the first drop of design that set the tone for all of the current website.</p>
<p>The logo combines lots of features that combine with his own artistic style. It is round, implying friendliness, it has a handwritten-like font, which is rotated and skewed, to maximize the vintage effect. There is a gap between the ring and the circle, which was inspired by our first landing page (The space for the sewed line), and the name "Corbin Hale" fits very well within the circle.</p>
<h2>The Final Website</h2>

<p>After the logo was done, we brainstormed on a new design style. Something that was still vintage, but with lighter, pastel colours, and, at the same time, a more modern look.</p>
<p>The final website combines some pastel and organic light colours, flat design vintage shapes, some handwritten fonts as well as some classic typographic fonts. The website is built with HTML5 and CSS3 technologies, responsive design, and carefully planned typography to improve readability in articles, all of this to improve the user experience and deliver a sleek look.
