<p><span class="firstcharacter">C</span>orbin Hale, the vintage pop artist, asked me to design a logo and a website. After many iterations, a beautiful vintage website emerged together with his eye-catching logo.</p>
<h2>The Landing Page</h2>
<p>Before Corbin Hale even had the name Corbin Hale, he was thinking of naming himself Corbin Thompson. Afraid of having someone else use this name, he quickly bought a domain name and now he needed a landing page.</p>
<p>He came to me one night and explained the whole concept of his artistic style. I made some sketches and we decided that we would make a great use of fabric to set the vintage theme. The message layout was inspired by those jeans labels, and the background's pattern was inspired by my own handbag. In the end, it turned out to be a great combination! The result is as below.</p>

<h2>The Old 50's Theater</h2>
<p>As soon as I started designing the website, he changed his artistic name to Corbin Hale. For the website, we were brainstorming many ways we could transmit the idea of vintage. He wanted the website to seem like it came from the 50's. So, I thought "What's more 50's"ish" than an old movie theater full of neon lights?" And so I did a mockup, and then the design itself. The result is as below: (Or <a target="_blank" href="articles/CorbinSite/Old50s/">click here</a> for demo)</p>

<p class="pullquote">"It's classy, vintage and it just seems like there is not a thing I'd change in it" – Corbin Hale</p>
<p>This Logo was designed before the website because the artist needed it for his YouTube Channel. It was the first drop of design that</p>
<p>It wasn't too long ago that there was one set of rules for use of type on print and use of type on screen. Now that we have screens that are essentially print quality, we have to reevaluate these conventions.</p>
<p> Web sites are transforming from boring fields of Arial to embrace the gamut of typographical possibilities offered by web fonts. Web fonts, combined with the style and layout options presented by the creative use of CSS and JavaScript offer a new world of typographic opportunity on the web. </p>
<h2>Emotional Typography</h2>
<p>Web fonts allow for a wider palette of typefaces which can provide far more quirkiness and personality.</p>
<p>The challenge is to help people understand this. The classics such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana or Tahoma are engrained as fonts you will always expect to see; readers aren't used to seeing type choices beyond these usual suspects.</p>
<p>The majority of screen graphics are done with JPGs that don't scale from the regular screens to retina screens. Now if you have these new type choices as web fonts, you have a scalable version of this which you can use, providing endless possibilities.</p>
<h2>Technical Advantages</h2>
<p>Think of this as adapting your tone of voice to the type of person or situation you are in. If you were being given a medical diagnosis the tone would not be fun or light-hearted. In contrast talking colloquially to a close friend could be the opposite of this.</p>
<p>Web fonts allow you to have this kind of razor-sharp efficiency and elegance in design whilst at the same time avoiding the need for adding additional page graphics, which in turn add load time, decrease workflow performance and risk breaking across screen dimensions and device situations.</p>
