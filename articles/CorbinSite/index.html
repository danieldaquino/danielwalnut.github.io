<p><span class="firstcharacter">C</span>orbin Hale is a pop/rock musician who asked me to design a logo and a website that integrated both his vintage design signature and his modern/retro pop-rock music.  Below, you will be able to navigate through some of the highlights of how my work with Corbin developed from the landing page to a beautiful website together with a brand new eye-catching logo. </p>
<h2>The Landing Page</h2>
<p>Before he published his brand, he wanted to do some design experimenting with the undercover name of Corbin Thompson. I made some sketches and we decided that we would make a great use of fabric to set the vintage theme. The message layout was inspired by old jeans labels, and the background’s pattern was inspired by my own handbag! (Yes, inspiration comes from anywhere). In the end, it turned out to be a great combination as you can see below:</p>

<h2>The Old 50's Theater</h2>
<p>For the website, we were brainstorming many ways we could transmit the idea of vintage. Corbin wanted his website to seem like it came from the 50s. And what is more 50s is than an old movie theater full of neon lights? (<a target="_blank" href="articles/CorbinSite/Old50s/">Click here</a> or on the picture for demo)</p>

<h2>The Logo</h2>

<p class="pullquote">"It captures my brand and visuals… just perfectly." – Corbin Hale</p>
<p>This Logo was designed before the website was ready because the artist needed it for his YouTube Channel. It was the first drop of design that set the tone for all of the current website.</p>
<p>The logo combines lots of features that match with his own artistic style. It is round, implying friendliness, it has a handwritten-like font, which is rotated and skewed, to maximize the vintage effect. There is a gap between the ring and the circle, which was inspired by our first landing page (The space for the sewed line), and the name "Corbin Hale" fits very well within the circle.</p>
<h2>The Second version</h2>

<p>After the logo was done, we brainstormed on a new design style. Something that was still vintage, but with lighter, pastel colours, and, at the same time, a more modern look.</p>
<p>The second version combines some pastel and organic light colours, flat design vintage shapes, some handwritten fonts as well as some classic typographic fonts. The website is built with HTML5 and CSS3 technologies, responsive design, and carefully planned typography to improve readability in articles, all of this to improve the user experience and deliver a sleek look.</p>

<p> With a final twist, we decided to combine the best of both worlds, and created this beautiful version. Checkout his website! And listen to his music! <a href="http://corbinhale.com" target="_blank">Corbin Hale's Website</a>
