<p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>n June 25th, 2017, we can't barely believe our ears as we hear the name of our team being called as the winner of the weekend, after all that we have been through. But what exactly happened?</p>
<h2>Day 1 — The Hackathon</h2>
<p>On the first day, there I was, writing ideas on a notebook, in front of the tall glass doors of the Cadillac Fairview building. The Vancouver Global AI Hackathon was about to begin.</p>
<p>As I entered, I immediately started gathering people for my team. The first idea, Jarvis Note, now had a team full of excited people.</p>

<h2>First night, first problem</h2>
<p>After all the fuzz, we immediately rushed to the boards, the papers and the keyboards to work like crazy. Excitement and hard work was all around.</p>
<p>Then, to our surprise, we find that a similar idea was already implemented on our target platform. The whole team just stopped and silence filled in the room. Everyone got impacted, and we didn't know what to do.</p>
<h2>Second day — More problems</h2>
<p>On the next day, we showed up at the Mobify HQ only to find that half of our team was nowhere to be seen, and were unreachable.</p>
<p>Before the idea of giving up filled our minds, we decided to move on and keep working on a better idea. Our team also got bigger because we recruited some other team orphans. We had no time to waste and we got our hands dirty.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, progress was slow, and some team members preferred working on different ideas. We kept coding.</p>
<p>At night, we all failed in our attempts, and it seemed like victory was too far to become true.</p>
<h2>The turn of events — The MeetScribe idea</h2>
<p>Tired, unrested, underfed, and sick of eating just granola bars, we were about to go home. </p>
<p>Then, suddenly, an idea showed up. This time, it felt like something that was feasible to do, and could still make a great demo.</p>
<p>And so, we picked up our laptops and coded through the night. Then, when the sun came up… We kept coding.</p>
<p>It was almost time for the final pitches when we finally had something demoable. The presentation? Oh, we had to rehearse it quietly in our minds while the others pitched.</p>
<p>Then, finally, the moment of truth. We delivered an amazing pitch that awarded us a Unanimous Victory.</p>

<h2>Update: We also won the Global Challenge!</h2>
<p>We were informed that we won the competition among 1200 participants, 220+ projects in 15 different cities around the globe!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for our next demo, in the beginning of October, in Paris, France.</p>
